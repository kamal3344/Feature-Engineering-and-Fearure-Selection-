# Feature Engineering 

In This Repo I am completely posting the Data Preprocessing on structure Data.
Since Data Preprocessing was one of the most challenging task for many of the ML Engineers I came-up with this repo to share all the important techniques which are usefull to clean the data.

# Steps to follow for developing Ml Models 

        - Data collecting 
        - Selecting Required Packages 
        - Handling NUll values for Numerical and Categorical data 
        - converting Categorical_data features to Numerical features
        - Varibale Transformation 
        - Handling Outliers 
        - Selecting the Best Features for the Model
                   - This techniques come under Feature Selection                          
        - Developing few Model
        - Selecting Best model to get better performances on test data  
        - Saving the Model 
        - Using Flask or Djano creating an UI to post inputs from the customers 
        - Hosting the Project in some cloud serives like
                 - AWS
                 - Azure 
                 - Google cloud
                 - Salesforce Heroku etc..

## Feature selection for structure data

After completing feature-engineering we are now ready to select the best fearures for our model 
there are some techniques which helps us to select the best features.

- Filter-Method
- Wrapper Method
- Embedded Method
- Statistical Method
- Correlation
